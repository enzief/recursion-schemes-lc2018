/**
  * It's time to confront ourselves to the real world of manipulating data with Spark & Avro
  * Two specific pain points we have to tackle are :
  *
  * - Spark's org.apache.spark.sql.Row is basically a wrapper of Array[Any]
  * but we need to handle two specifically different behaviour according to the level of the data :
  * When we're handling Arrays and Structs, no worry we need to output a Row
  * but when we're handling "simple" types, then if it's a top-level value we need to output a Row
  * but if it's not, then the value itself must be written.
  *
  * Exemple :
  *   - Value("b") will be Row("b")
  * but
  *   - Struct(a -> Value("b")) will be Row("b") as well (the Row now representing the outer struct)
  *
  * - For Apache Avro, it's a new kind of pain you'll need to overcome, Avro basically represents all of its
  * data as if, it will be at one point or another generated into Java classes.
  * So every "record" or Struct needs to have a qualified name "unique" otherwise the Avro engine will consider
  * the struct as being the same class.
  * But as it will obviously have different fields - you'll most likely end up with an error.
  *
  * Happy hunting.

    * We have a proper way to overcome this problem. There is a `para` scheme that works a little bit like cata.
    * Using para, our algebra will "see" not only the result of its application to the level bellow but also
    * the structure of that level we just processed.
    *
    * To use para, we need a special kind of algebra : a GAlgebra. Given a functor F and a comonad W,
    * Galgebra[W, F, A] is simply a function F[W[A]] => A, so our carrier is simply wrapped in an additional
    * layer.
    *
    * For para's GAlgebra we use (T[F], ?) as our comonad, in other words, our carrier will be paired with the
    * "tree" we processed during the previous step.
    *
    * We will use that to know when we need to "unwrap" the value we had wrapped in a Row at the previous step
    * although we shouldn't have.
